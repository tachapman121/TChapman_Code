Senior School Project created with team of 4; React Mobile application was created by Trevor Chapman and Connor Ottenbacher.

App is designed to connect to air pollution sensors created by research group at University of Utah, pulling information in addition to connecting to them using BlueTooth Low Energy to check the status and connect them to WiFi networks by sending username and passwords. Also allows users to create an account for managing owned sensors.

In addition, contains small sub-app (created by Connor Ottenbacher) that tracks user's movements as they walk an area and compares with pollution sensors in area to give them idea of how much pollution they've been exposed to, along with possible health effects.
