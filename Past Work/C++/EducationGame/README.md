Small educational game created for class project in team of 5 using Qt. 

Game has player at bottom of screen that can move left or right to collect falling fruits or candy. Candy will cause the player to weigh more slowing them down, while fruit will slim them. Sugary foods will also cause a sugar rush, speeding the player up for short time and then causing them to slow down. Energy slowly ticks down eat loop; once it reaches 0 the game is over.

Every 10 points a quiz will appear asking the player to make a choice; correct choices will advance the game speeding it up while incorrect will restart the level.

Scores are sent to SQL database, which can be queried for high scores.
