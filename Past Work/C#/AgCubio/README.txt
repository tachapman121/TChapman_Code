C# Class Project created by Xiaoyung Ding and Trevor Chapman. Simplified version of http://agar.io/ , allowing small number of users to connect to server and play game. Saves scores to database; web pages can then be accessed to view stats. AgCubioGUI contains front end client, AgCubioServer contains HTML and handles requests for game, NetworkController contains code for syncing with server.
